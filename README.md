Arma is a great game, and sqf is a decent enough platform for creating just about any simulation environment you can imagine. With that said, while the Arma developer community is getting better, it sucks. I'd like to do my part to change that with the following collection of tutorials, examples, snippets, and tips.

As I use community scripts in my projects, I will post the cleaned up code here, along with documentation explaining the use of each script along with examples.


### BIS Functions
Unsure of where to start? Be sure to scrutinize the following official functions from BIS, as they add a ton of functionality and make scripting appear much less daunting (much of the *heavy lifting* of creating Arma projects has already been handled by BIS in one form or another, especially now that the series has built upon so many iterations):

### Disclaimer
Please note that I am not the original author of many of the scripts discussed here. I do however modify, clean, or otherwise streamline the scripts extensively to ensure that I fully understand them during the corresponding discussion, and to ensure they integrate well with the my own scripts.
